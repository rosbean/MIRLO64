# tlb_bench: the CPU's TLB instructions (tlb_bench.c) as a game on the SoC in sim/mips_soc: their results, and what each costs.
#
#   make -f tlb_bench.mk [MIRLO=<checkout>] [BUILD=<dir>] [MIPS_CC=... MIPS_BIN=...]       -> $(BUILD)/tlb_bench.z64
#   (a ROM the OWN loader runs as it is). A loader made with TLBPROF=1 turns the game's stores to 0x0490_0004 into the simulation's
#   marks; then, in sim/mips_soc:
#     ROM=$(BUILD)/tlb_bench.z64 CPUSTAT=1 DUMP=0x43B00000,64 stdbuf -oL obj_soc/tb_soc <loader n64rt.bin> -c 120
#   The "[cpustat N cycles" lines at the marks are the six timings of tlb_bench.c in its order (CPU clocks, divided by the number of
#   instructions in it: 32 x ROUNDS tlbr, 32 x ROUNDS tlbp that finds nothing, the same that finds the last entry, ROUNDS x 32 tlbwi
#   that change nothing, 2 x 4 x ROUNDS tlbwi that map and unmap a page, 4 x ROUNDS tlbwr); the DUMP shows 0x600D600D at +0 when the
#   results are right and the checksum at +4, the same for any runtime that does the instructions as the VR4300 does.
